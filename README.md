**Important note:** If you want to apply the methodoly used in the paper rather
than simply reproduce the results, check out
[Marble](https://github.com/scities/marble), a python library to analyse
residential segregation.


## Use

You will need  *GNU Make*, *curl*, *git* and Python 2.7 installed on your machine (this should be
the case if your machine runs linux. Otherwise [Google](http://www.google.com)
is your best friend).  This was tested on Arch Linux and Python 2.7.9. Feel free
to [start an issue](https://github.com/rlouf/socio-spatial-stratification/issues/new) if you cannot run the code.

### Clone the repository

In command line, type

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rlouf/socio-spatial-stratification *your_folder_name*
```

This should download all the files and data necessary to *your_folder_name*.

### Dependencies


To install the python libraries necessary to run the code, go to the cloned folder and type in command line

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the analysis

Go into the corresponding folder and type 

```bash
make
```
The programme will prepare the data, perform the analysis and plot the figures in the folder 'figures'.
