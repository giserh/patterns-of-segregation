# Socio Spatial Stratification in cities

Python scripts and data necessary to reproduce the results from the paper "Socio-spatial stratification in cities"

[citation here]

**Important note:** If you want to apply the methodoly used in the paper rather than simply reproduce the results, have a look at marble, a python library to analyse residential segregation.

## Dependencies

Python 2.7
Matplotlib
Numpy
Shapely

## Use

Clone the repository, go into the corresponding folder and type 'make' in the console. The programme will prepare the data, perform the analysis and plot the figures in the folder 'figures'.
This has only been tested in Arch Linux, it should work for Mac Users as well. I have no idea for Windows users.
